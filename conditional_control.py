#Lets practice conditional control statements in Python
# This snippet demonstrates the use of conditional control statements in Python.

# Initialize a variable
x = 10
# Check if x is greater than 5
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
# Check if x is less than 5
elif x < 5:
    print("x is less than 5")
